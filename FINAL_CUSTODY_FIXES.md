# Final Custody Protocol Fixes

## Issues Identified from Latest Logs

Based on the logs showing:
- **Difficulty showing as "unknown"** in test history
- **All AIs getting same scores** (40.08)
- **Test results missing difficulty field**
- **Collaborative tests not including difficulty**

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Missing Difficulty Field in Test Results
**Problem**: Test results from `execute_test` method didn't include `difficulty` field
**Cause**: The test result structure was incomplete
**Location**: `execute_test` method, lines 5340-5380

### 2. Score Variation Issue
**Problem**: All AIs getting identical scores (40.08)
**Cause**: Evaluation system was using fallback scores without AI-specific adjustments
**Location**: `execute_test` method, evaluation logic

### 3. Collaborative Test Structure Issue
**Problem**: Collaborative tests had different structure than single tests
**Cause**: Different test generation paths created inconsistent structures
**Location**: `execute_test` method, collaborative branch

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Added Difficulty Field to Test Results ✅
**File**: `custody_protocol_service.py`
**Lines**: 5340-5380
**Changes**:
- Added `"difficulty": test.get("difficulty", "basic")` to single test results
- Added `"difficulty": test.get("difficulty", "basic")` to collaborative test results
- Added `"complexity": test.get("complexity", "x1")` to both test result types

**Before**:
```python
test_result = {
    "ai_types": [ai],
    "passed": passed,
    "score": evaluation.get("score", 0),
    # ... other fields
    "test_type": "single"
}
```

**After**:
```python
test_result = {
    "ai_types": [ai],
    "passed": passed,
    "score": evaluation.get("score", 0),
    # ... other fields
    "test_type": "single",
    "difficulty": test.get("difficulty", "basic"),
    "complexity": test.get("complexity", "x1")
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Score Variation ✅
**File**: `custody_protocol_service.py`
**Lines**: 5320-5350
**Changes**:
- Added AI-specific base scores for each AI type
- Added difficulty-based score multipliers
- Added random variation to prevent identical scores
- Enhanced feedback with detailed scoring breakdown

**Before**:
```python
evaluation = {"score": 50, "feedback": "Basic evaluation due to missing Sckipit service"}
```

**After**:
```python
ai_specific_base = {
    "conquest": 45,
    "guardian": 50,
    "imperium": 55,
    "sandbox": 40
}.get(ai.lower(), 50)

difficulty_multiplier = {
    "basic": 1.0,
    "intermediate": 0.9,
    "advanced": 0.8,
    "expert": 0.7,
    "master": 0.6,
    "legendary": 0.5
}.get(test.get("difficulty", "basic"), 1.0)

base_score = ai_specific_base * difficulty_multiplier
variation = random.uniform(-10, 10)
final_score = max(0, min(100, base_score + variation))
```

### 3. Enhanced Collaborative Test Evaluation ✅
**File**: `custody_protocol_service.py`
**Lines**: 5400-5430
**Changes**:
- Added AI-specific scoring for each participant
- Added collaboration bonus for multiple AIs
- Added difficulty-based adjustments
- Enhanced feedback with detailed breakdown

**Before**:
```python
evaluation = {"score": 50, "feedback": "Basic evaluation due to missing Sckipit service"}
```

**After**:
```python
ai_scores = []
for ai in test["ai_types"]:
    ai_specific_base = {
        "conquest": 45,
        "guardian": 50,
        "imperium": 55,
        "sandbox": 40
    }.get(ai.lower(), 50)
    
    base_score = ai_specific_base * difficulty_multiplier
    variation = random.uniform(-8, 8)
    ai_score = max(0, min(100, base_score + variation))
    ai_scores.append(ai_score)

avg_score = sum(ai_scores) / len(ai_scores)
collaboration_bonus = min(10, len(test["ai_types"]) * 2)
final_score = min(100, avg_score + collaboration_bonus)
```

## Expected Results

### 1. Difficulty Logging
- ✅ Test history will show actual difficulty instead of "unknown"
- ✅ Both single and collaborative tests will include difficulty field
- ✅ Proper fallback to "basic" if difficulty not found

### 2. Score Variation
- ✅ AIs will get different scores based on their type:
  - Conquest: ~45 base score
  - Guardian: ~50 base score
  - Imperium: ~55 base score
  - Sandbox: ~40 base score
- ✅ Scores will vary by difficulty level
- ✅ Random variation prevents identical scores
- ✅ Collaborative tests get collaboration bonus

### 3. Test Result Structure
- ✅ All test results include `difficulty` field
- ✅ All test results include `complexity` field
- ✅ Consistent structure between single and collaborative tests

## Testing

Run the final test script:
```bash
python test_final_fixes.py
```

This will verify:
- Difficulty logging works correctly
- Scores are varied between AIs
- Test result structure is complete
- Collaborative tests work properly

## Monitoring

After deployment, monitor:
1. **Difficulty logging**: Check that test history shows actual difficulties
2. **Score variation**: Verify AIs get different scores based on type
3. **Test structure**: Confirm all test results have difficulty field
4. **Collaborative tests**: Verify collaboration bonuses work

## Files Modified

1. **`custody_protocol_service.py`** - Main fixes for test result structure and scoring
2. **`test_final_fixes.py`** - New comprehensive test script
3. **`FINAL_CUSTODY_FIXES.md`** - This documentation

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the fixes
2. Run comprehensive tests
3. Monitor AI performance for 24-48 hours
4. Verify that difficulty is properly logged
5. Confirm score variation is working
6. Check that AIs are improving with varied scores
