- **Book of Lorgar**: Added `subject` field for enhanced knowledge base building
- **Database**: Subject fields added to both `oath_papers` and `training_data` tables

### 2. Enhanced AI Learning Service
- **OpenAI Integration**: Uses GPT-4 for comprehensive subject research
- **Anthropic Integration**: Uses Claude for knowledge synthesis and analysis
- **Internet Search**: Real-time information gathering from Google Custom Search
- **Knowledge Synthesis**: Combines multiple sources into comprehensive knowledge bases

### 3. Subject Research Capabilities
- **Keyword Extraction**: Automatic extraction of relevant keywords
- **Learning Paths**: Generated learning recommendations
- **Code Examples**: Relevant code examples for technical subjects
- **Best Practices**: Identified best practices for each subject
- **Common Pitfalls**: Warning about common mistakes
- **Advanced Concepts**: Expert-level knowledge identification
