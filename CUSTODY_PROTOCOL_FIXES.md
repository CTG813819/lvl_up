# Custody Protocol Fixes for Failing AIs

## Problem Identified

The custody metrics showed an AI with:
- **139 total tests given**
- **1 test passed**
- **138 tests failed**
- **131 consecutive failures**
- **Consistent scores around 40.08** (partial credit but failing)

The AI was stuck in a failure loop with difficulty not being reduced appropriately.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Difficulty adjustment logic was too conservative** - required 20+ consecutive failures to force BASIC difficulty
2. **Real-world tests were only triggered after 5+ failures** instead of 3+
3. **No complexity reduction** for failing AIs
4. **No threshold adjustment** for failing AIs
5. **No forced BASIC difficulty** for AIs with excessive failures

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. More Aggressive Difficulty Reduction

**File:** `app/services/custody_protocol_service.py`
**Method:** `_adjust_difficulty_based_on_performance()`

**Changes:**
- Reduced threshold from 20 to 10 consecutive failures for forcing BASIC difficulty
- Added difficulty reduction for even 1 consecutive failure
- Added fallback to BASIC difficulty on any error

```python
# CRITICAL FIX: More aggressive difficulty reduction for consecutive failures
if consecutive_failures >= 10:
    return TestDifficulty.BASIC
elif consecutive_failures >= 5:
    return TestDifficulty.BASIC
elif consecutive_failures >= 3:
    return TestDifficulty.BASIC
elif consecutive_failures >= 1:
    return self._decrease_difficulty(base_difficulty, 1)
```

### 2. Earlier Real-World Test Triggering

**File:** `app/services/custody_protocol_service.py`
**Method:** `_generate_custody_test()`

**Changes:**
- Reduced threshold from 5 to 3 consecutive failures for real-world tests

```python
# Check if we should use real-world tests (for AIs with poor performance)
if custody_metrics and custody_metrics.get('consecutive_failures', 0) >= 3:
    return await self._generate_real_world_test(ai_type, difficulty, category, learning_history)
```

### 3. Complexity Reduction for Failing AIs

**File:** `app/services/custody_protocol_service.py`
**Method:** `_generate_custody_test()`

**Changes:**
- Force single complexity layer for AIs with 5+ consecutive failures

```python
# CRITICAL FIX: Reduce complexity for failing AIs
if custody_metrics and custody_metrics.get('consecutive_failures', 0) >= 5:
    complexity_layers = 1  # Force single layer for failing AIs
```

### 4. Threshold Adjustment for Failing AIs

**File:** `app/services/custody_protocol_service.py`
**Method:** `_execute_custody_test()`

**Changes:**
- Lower threshold by 20 points for AIs with 5+ consecutive failures
- Minimum threshold of 50

```python
# CRITICAL FIX: Lower threshold for failing AIs
if custody_metrics and custody_metrics.get('consecutive_failures', 0) >= 5:
    threshold = max(50, threshold - 20)  # Lower threshold by 20 points, minimum 50
```

### 5. Forced BASIC Difficulty for Excessive Failures

**File:** `app/services/custody_protocol_service.py`
**Method:** `_update_custody_metrics()`

**Changes:**
- Force BASIC difficulty for AIs with 20+ consecutive failures

```python
# CRITICAL FIX: Force BASIC difficulty for AIs with excessive failures
if metrics.get('consecutive_failures', 0) >= 20:
    new_difficulty = TestDifficulty.BASIC
```

## Expected Results

With these fixes:

1. **AIs with 3+ consecutive failures** will get real-world tests
2. **AIs with 5+ consecutive failures** will get:
   - Single complexity layer tests
   - Lowered thresholds (easier to pass)
3. **AIs with 10+ consecutive failures** will be forced to BASIC difficulty
4. **AIs with 20+ consecutive failures** will be forced to BASIC difficulty regardless of other factors

## Testing

A test script `test_custody_fixes.py` has been created to verify:
- Difficulty adjustment works correctly
- Threshold adjustment works correctly
- Test generation produces appropriate complexity

## Monitoring

The system now includes enhanced logging to track:
- Difficulty adjustment decisions
- Threshold adjustments
- Complexity layer reductions
- Forced BASIC difficulty applications

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the fixes** to the production environment
2. **Monitor the failing AI** to see if it starts passing tests
3. **Run the test script** to verify fixes are working
4. **Consider additional improvements** if needed:
   - Even more aggressive difficulty reduction
   - Special "recovery mode" for AIs with 50+ consecutive failures
   - Adaptive learning rate adjustments

## Impact

These fixes should help failing AIs:
- **Break out of failure loops** by getting easier tests
- **Build confidence** with more achievable goals
- **Learn progressively** from basic to more complex challenges
- **Avoid getting stuck** in impossible difficulty levels
