# Stricter Testing Rules and Notification System

## Overview

This implementation enforces stricter rules for proposal filtering and adds comprehensive notifications for live testing and proposal status changes.

## üîí Stricter Proposal Filtering

### Before
- Proposals were shown to users if `status == "test-passed"`
- No check for `test_status` field

### After
- **Stricter Rule**: Proposals are only shown to users if BOTH:
  - `status == "test-passed"` 
  - `test_status == "passed"`

### Implementation
```python
# In app/routers/proposals.py
query = query.where(
    Proposal.status == "test-passed",
    Proposal.test_status == "passed"
)
```

This ensures that:
- ‚úÖ Only proposals that have passed live testing are shown to users
- ‚úÖ No pending proposals with failed tests reach users
- ‚úÖ No proposals with test errors reach users
- ‚úÖ Admin can still see all proposals via `/api/proposals/all`

## üîî Notification System

### New Notification Service
Created `app/services/notification_service.py` with comprehensive notification functionality:

#### Notification Types
1. **Live Testing Started** - When a proposal begins live testing
2. **Live Testing Completed** - When live testing finishes (success/failure/error)
3. **Proposal Ready** - When a proposal passes testing and is ready for users
4. **AI Learning Triggered** - When AI learns from failed tests

#### Notification Priorities
- **Normal**: Live testing started, proposal ready, AI learning
- **High**: Live testing failed, live testing error

### Notification Integration

#### Proposal Creation Flow
```python
# 1. Send notification when live testing starts
await notification_service.notify_live_test_started(...)

# 2. Run live tests
overall_result, summary, detailed_results = await testing_service.test_proposal(...)

# 3. Send notification about test completion
await notification_service.notify_live_test_completed(...)

# 4. If passed, send notification that proposal is ready
if overall_result.value == "passed":
    await notification_service.notify_proposal_ready_for_user(...)

# 5. If failed, trigger learning and send notification
elif overall_result.value == "failed":
    await notification_service.notify_learning_triggered(...)
```

#### Proposal Acceptance Flow
- Same notification flow as creation
- Notifications sent for both testing start and completion

### Notification API Endpoints

#### GET `/api/notifications/`
- Get all notifications
- Optional `unread_only=true` parameter
- Optional `limit` parameter

#### POST `/api/notifications/{notification_id}/read`
- Mark a notification as read

#### POST `/api/notifications/mark-all-read`
- Mark all notifications as read

#### GET `/api/notifications/stats`
- Get notification statistics
- Total, unread, read counts
- Breakdown by type and priority

#### DELETE `/api/notifications/{notification_id}`
- Delete a notification (marks as read for now)

## üìä Database Schema

### Notification Model
```python
class Notification(Base):
    id = Column(UUID, primary_key=True)
    title = Column(String(200), nullable=False)
    message = Column(Text, nullable=False)
    type = Column(String(50), nullable=False, index=True)
    priority = Column(String(20), default="normal", index=True)
    read = Column(Boolean, default=False, index=True)
    notification_data = Column(JSON, nullable=True)
    created_at = Column(DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow, index=True)
```

### Notification Types
- `live_testing` - Live testing started
- `live_testing_success` - Live testing passed
- `live_testing_failure` - Live testing failed
- `live_testing_error` - Live testing error
- `proposal_ready` - Proposal ready for users
- `ai_learning` - AI learning triggered

## üß™ Testing

### Test Script
Run `test_stricter_proposals_and_notifications.py` to verify:

1. **Proposal Filtering Test**
   - Only proposals with `status="test-passed"` AND `test_status="passed"` are returned
   - Failed proposals are filtered out

2. **Notification System Test**
   - Notifications are created and stored
   - Different notification types are working
   - Notification statistics are accurate

3. **Admin Access Test**
   - Admin can see all proposals including failed ones
   - User-facing endpoint properly filters

4. **Notification Stats Test**
   - Statistics are calculated correctly
   - Breakdown by type and priority works

## üîç Monitoring Live Testing and Learning

### How to Check If Live Testing is Working

1. **Check Logs**
   ```bash
   # Look for these log messages:
   "Running LIVE testing on proposal - NO STUBS"
   "Proposal passed LIVE testing"
   "Proposal failed LIVE testing"
   "Error learning from failed test"
   ```

2. **Check Notifications**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/notifications/
   ```

3. **Check Database**
   ```sql
   -- Check proposal statuses
   SELECT status, test_status, COUNT(*) 
   FROM proposals 
   GROUP BY status, test_status;
   
   -- Check notifications
   SELECT type, COUNT(*) 
   FROM notifications 
   GROUP BY type;
   ```

### How to Check If Learning is Working

1. **Check for Learning Notifications**
   - Look for `ai_learning` type notifications
   - Check for "AI Learning Triggered" messages

2. **Check Learning Service Logs**
   - Look for "Learning from failure" messages
   - Check for "Successfully learned from failure" messages

3. **Check for New Proposals After Learning**
   - Failed proposals should trigger new improved proposals
   - Check for proposals with learning context

## üöÄ Usage

### For Users
- Only see proposals that have passed live testing
- Get notified when new proposals are ready
- Get notified about AI learning activities

### For Admins
- Can see all proposals via `/api/proposals/all`
- Can monitor notifications via `/api/notifications/`
- Can track live testing and learning via notifications

### For Developers
- Live testing is enforced for all proposals
- Learning is automatically triggered on failures
- Notifications provide real-time feedback

## üîß Configuration

### Notification Settings
- Notifications are stored in the database
- Can be configured to send via WebSocket, email, or other channels
- Priority levels: normal, high, critical

### Testing Settings
- Live testing is required for all proposals (`require_live_tests = True`)
- Test timeout: 120 seconds
- Graceful failure: disabled (fail fast)

## üìà Benefits

1. **Quality Assurance**: Only high-quality, tested proposals reach users
2. **Transparency**: Users know when proposals are being tested
3. **Learning**: AI automatically learns from failures
4. **Monitoring**: Real-time notifications for all activities
5. **Admin Control**: Admins can see everything while users see filtered results

## üîÑ Workflow

1. **Proposal Created** ‚Üí Live Testing Started Notification
2. **Live Testing Runs** ‚Üí All tests executed (syntax, lint, unit, integration, security, performance, live deployment)
3. **Testing Complete** ‚Üí Live Testing Completed Notification
4. **If Passed** ‚Üí Proposal Ready Notification + Show to Users
5. **If Failed** ‚Üí AI Learning Triggered Notification + Generate Improved Proposal
6. **Users See** ‚Üí Only proposals that passed both status and test_status checks
