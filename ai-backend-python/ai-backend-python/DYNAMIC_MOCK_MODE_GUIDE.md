# Dynamic Mock Mode System Guide

## Overview

The app now uses a **dynamic mock mode system** that automatically switches between real and mock mode based on backend connectivity and operational hours. This solves the issue where the app was hardcoded to always use mock mode.

## ‚úÖ **New Features Added**

### 1. **Operational Hours Awareness**
- **Automatic Detection**: The system knows when it's outside operational hours (5 AM - 9 PM)
- **Smart Fallback**: When outside hours, the app stays in mock mode even if backend is available
- **Automatic Recovery**: When operational hours resume, the app automatically tries to reconnect

### 2. **Manual Retry Button**
- **Retry Connection**: Tap the refresh icon in the app bar to manually retry backend connection
- **Smart Retry Logic**: Only attempts connection during operational hours
- **Visual Feedback**: Shows success/failure status with colored notifications

### 3. **Enhanced Mock Mode Indicators**
- **App Bar Indicator**: Compact "Mock" badge appears when in mock mode
- **Banner Warning**: Prominent orange banner shows when mock mode is active
- **Status Chips**: Shows which systems (Proposals/AI Learning) are in mock mode
- **Tap for Details**: Tap the mock indicator to see detailed status

### 4. **Fixed System Status Text Overlap**
- **Improved Layout**: Fixed text overlap in system status indicators
- **Better Spacing**: Added proper constraints and spacing
- **Responsive Design**: Text adapts to available space

## üîß **How It Works**

### **Start in Real Mode**
- Both `ProposalProvider` and `AILearningProvider` start in **real mode** (`_useMockMode = false`)
- The app attempts to connect to the backend immediately

### **Automatic Fallback to Mock Mode**
- If the backend is unavailable, the app tracks consecutive failures
- After **3 consecutive failures**, it automatically switches to mock mode
- **Operational Hours Check**: If outside 5 AM - 9 PM, stays in mock mode regardless
- Users get a notification: "üé≠ Backend Unavailable - Switched to mock mode"

### **Automatic Recovery to Real Mode**
- The app continuously checks backend connectivity
- When backend becomes available **AND** within operational hours, switches back to real mode
- Users get a notification: "‚úÖ Backend Connected - Switched to real mode"

### **Manual Control**
- **Retry Button**: Tap refresh icon to manually retry connection
- **Force Real Mode**: For testing, can force switch to real mode
- **Force Mock Mode**: For testing, can force switch to mock mode

## üéØ **Visual Indicators**

### **App Bar Indicators**
```
[üîß] [üè∞] [ü§ñ] [‚ö†Ô∏è Mock]  ‚Üê Mock mode indicator
```

### **Mock Mode Banner**
```
üé≠ Mock Mode Active
Using local AI proposals - Backend unavailable or outside operational hours
[Retry] [Proposals: Mock] [AI Learning: Mock]
```

### **Status Colors**
- **Green**: Real mode, connected to backend
- **Orange**: Mock mode, using local data
- **Red**: Error state

## üß™ **Testing the System**

### **Test Backend Connection**
1. Tap the debug button (bug icon) in proposal approval screen
2. View connection status and test results
3. Check mode, backend availability, and failure count

### **Test Manual Retry**
1. Tap the refresh icon in the app bar
2. Watch for success/failure notification
3. Check if mode switches appropriately

### **Test Operational Hours**
1. Outside 5 AM - 9 PM: App stays in mock mode
2. Within 5 AM - 9 PM: App can switch to real mode if backend available
3. Chaos mode: Overrides operational hours (allows AI operations)

### **Force Mode Testing**
```dart
// Force real mode for testing
proposalProvider.forceRealMode();

// Force mock mode for testing  
proposalProvider.forceMockMode();
```

## üîç **Debugging**

### **Check Current Status**
```dart
final status = proposalProvider.getConnectionStatus();
print('Mode: ${status['mode']}');
print('Backend Available: ${status['backendAvailable']}');
print('Failures: ${status['consecutiveFailures']}');
```

### **Test Backend Connectivity**
```dart
await proposalProvider.testBackendConnection();
```

### **Monitor Logs**
Look for these log messages:
- `[PROPOSAL_PROVIDER] ‚úÖ Backend is healthy and responding`
- `[PROPOSAL_PROVIDER] ‚ùå Backend failure #1: Connection timeout`
- `[PROPOSAL_PROVIDER] üîÑ Too many failures - switching to mock mode`
- `[PROPOSAL_PROVIDER] ‚è∞ Outside operational hours - staying in mock mode`

## üöÄ **Usage Examples**

### **Normal Operation**
1. App starts in real mode
2. Connects to backend successfully
3. Shows green indicators
4. Uses real AI proposals and learning data

### **Backend Unavailable**
1. App detects backend failure
2. After 3 failures, switches to mock mode
3. Shows orange mock mode banner
4. Uses local mock data
5. Continues to retry in background

### **Outside Operational Hours**
1. App detects it's outside 5 AM - 9 PM
2. Stays in mock mode regardless of backend status
3. Shows "Outside Hours" message
4. Waits for operational hours to resume

### **Manual Retry**
1. User taps retry button
2. App checks operational hours
3. If within hours, attempts backend connection
4. Shows success/failure notification
5. Updates mode accordingly

## üîß **Configuration**

### **Operational Hours**
- **Start**: 5:00 AM
- **End**: 9:00 PM (21:00)
- **Format**: 24-hour
