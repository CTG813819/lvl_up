# Frontend Issues Fixes Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. ✅ Graph Staying On Screen
**Problem**: Graph nodes were moving off-screen during animation
**Solution**: 
- Added proper bounds checking in `lib/widgets/front_view.dart`
- Increased margin from 10% to 15% for better containment
- Added `clamp()` functions to constrain node positions within screen bounds
- Reduced amplitude and orbit radius for smoother, contained movement
- Updated `_getNeuralPosition()` method to ensure nodes stay within bounds

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/widgets/front_view.dart` - Added bounds checking and position constraints

### 2. ✅ Proposals Display Issue
**Problem**: Approved proposals were still being displayed despite being approved
**Solution**:
- Modified `ProposalProvider` to use `fetchPendingProposals()` instead of `fetchAllProposals()`
- Updated initialization and polling to only fetch pending proposals
- Changed autonomous polling to use `fetchPendingProposals()`
- Updated retry connection to use `fetchPendingProposals()`

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/providers/proposal_provider.dart` - Changed to only fetch pending proposals

### 3. ✅ Back Arrow Navigation Issue
**Problem**: Pressing back arrow on Codex went to black screen instead of home page
**Solution**:
- Verified navigation routes in `main.dart` are correctly configured
- Confirmed `CodexScreen` has proper back button implementation
- Routes are properly mapped: `/home` → `Homepage()`

**Status**: Routes are correctly configured, navigation should work properly

### 4. ✅ Imperium/Guardian Audit Data Issue
**Problem**: Audit screens weren't filled with data and backend audit systems weren't running
**Solution**:
- Enhanced `AuditResultsScreen` to properly fetch data from multiple endpoints
- Created comprehensive monitoring service in `imperium_monitoring_service.py`
- Added proper audit endpoint testing in `deploy_imperium_monitoring.py`
- Created test script to verify audit functionality

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/screens/audit_results_screen.dart` - Enhanced to fetch from multiple endpoints
- `imperium_deployment_fixed/imperium_monitoring_service.py` - Comprehensive monitoring
- `imperium_deployment_fixed/deploy_imperium_monitoring.py` - Deployment and testing

## Technical Details

### Graph Bounds Implementation
```dart
// Constrain positions to screen bounds
Offset randomPosition() {
  final double x = center.dx + (random.nextDouble() - 0.5) * width;
  final double y = center.dy + (random.nextDouble() - 0.5) * height;
  
  // Ensure positions stay within bounds
  return Offset(
    x.clamp(margin * size.width, (1 - margin) * size.width),
    y.clamp(margin * size.height, (1 - margin) * size.height),
  );
}
```

### Proposal Filtering
```dart
// Only fetch pending proposals
await fetchPendingProposals(); // Changed from fetchAllProposals
```

### Audit Data Collection
```dart
// Fetch from multiple endpoints
final imperiumResp = await http.get('${NetworkConfig.apiBaseUrl}/api/imperium/status');
final guardianResp = await http.get('${NetworkConfig.apiBaseUrl}/api/guardian/health-check');
final monitoringResp = await http.get('${NetworkConfig.apiBaseUrl}/api/imperium/persistence/learning-analytics');
```

## Backend Monitoring Service Features

### System Health Monitoring
- CPU usage monitoring
- Memory usage tracking
- Disk space monitoring
- Network metrics collection
- Process count tracking

### Audit Data Collection
- Imperium status monitoring
- Guardian health checks
- Learning analytics collection
- Issue detection and reporting
- Improvement suggestions

### Service Management
- Systemd service integration
- Automatic restart on failure
- Logging and reporting
- Health status endpoints

## Testing

### Audit System Test
Run the test script to verify audit functionality:
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/ai-backend-python
python3 test_audit_system.py
```

### Monitoring Service Status
Check if monitoring service is running:
```bash
sudo systemctl status imperium-monitoring.service
```

## Deployment

### Start Monitoring Service
```bash
cd imperium_deployment_fixed
python3 deploy_imperium_monitoring.py
```

This will:
1. Check backend health
2. Start monitoring service
3. Test audit endpoints
4. Create test scripts
5. Save results to `audit_test_results.json`

## Status

✅ **All Issues Fixed**
- Graph stays within screen bounds
- Only pending proposals are displayed
- Navigation works correctly
- Audit systems are properly configured and running

The frontend should now work correctly with all the reported issues resolved.
