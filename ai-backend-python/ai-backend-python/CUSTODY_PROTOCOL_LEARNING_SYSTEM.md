# Custody Protocol Learning System

## Overview

The Custody Protocol has been significantly enhanced to **learn from AI knowledge and learning history** to create adaptive, comprehensive tests that ensure AIs have truly mastered what they've learned. This system goes beyond basic testing to provide intelligent, personalized assessments based on each AI's actual learning journey.

## 🧠 **How the Custody Protocol Learns**

### 1. **Comprehensive Knowledge Analysis**

The Custody Protocol analyzes multiple data sources to understand what each AI has actually learned:

#### **Learning History Analysis**
- **OathPaper Entries**: Analyzes all learning documents created by each AI
- **Subject Diversity**: Tracks the variety of topics each AI has studied
- **Learning Depth**: Measures the complexity and depth of learning content
- **Learning Frequency**: Monitors how consistently each AI learns
- **Learning Patterns**: Identifies strengths and weaknesses in learning behavior

#### **Proposal History Analysis**
- **Success Rates**: Tracks proposal approval/rejection patterns
- **Code Quality Trends**: Analyzes complexity and readability scores
- **Improvement Types**: Classifies what types of changes each AI makes
- **Failure Patterns**: Identifies common issues in rejected proposals
- **File Type Expertise**: Tracks which file types each AI works with

#### **Knowledge Gap Identification**
- **Expected Knowledge**: Defines what each AI type should know
- **Current Knowledge**: Maps what each AI has actually learned
- **Gap Analysis**: Identifies missing knowledge areas
- **Learning Recommendations**: Suggests areas for improvement

### 2. **Adaptive Test Generation**

Based on the comprehensive analysis, the Custody Protocol generates tests that are:

#### **Personalized to Each AI**
- **Learning-Based Questions**: Tests specific topics each AI has studied
- **Gap-Targeting**: Focuses on areas where knowledge is lacking
- **Pattern-Aware**: Addresses learning strengths and weaknesses
- **Level-Appropriate**: Scales difficulty based on actual learning depth

#### **Comprehensive Coverage**
- **Knowledge Verification**: Tests understanding of learned concepts
- **Code Quality**: Analyzes actual code improvement patterns
- **Innovation Capability**: Tests creative application of knowledge
- **Self-Improvement**: Evaluates awareness of learning patterns

### 3. **Intelligent Test Categories**

The enhanced system uses adaptive testing for key categories:

#### **Adaptive Knowledge Verification**
```python
# Example: Tests based on actual learning
if knowledge_gaps:
    questions.append(f"Explain how you would approach learning about {gap}")
if recent_learning_focus:
    questions.append(f"How would you apply your knowledge of {recent_topic}?")
```

#### **Adaptive Code Quality Testing**
```python
# Example: Tests based on proposal patterns
if improvement_areas:
    questions.append(f"Analyze issues in your recent {area} proposals")
if success_rate < 0.7:
    questions.append("What patterns do you notice in your failed proposals?")
```

#### **Adaptive Innovation Testing**
```python
# Example: Tests based on learning synthesis
if recent_focus:
    questions.append(f"How would you innovate using {recent_topic}?")
if len(recent_focus) >= 2:
    questions.append(f"How would you combine {topic1} and {topic2}?")
```

## 🔍 **Learning Analysis Methods**

### 1. **Knowledge Analysis (`_analyze_ai_knowledge`)**

```python
async def _analyze_ai_knowledge(self, ai_type: str, learning_history: List[Dict]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Comprehensive analysis of AI's knowledge based on learning history"""
    
    # Extract learning patterns
    learning_patterns = await self._analyze_learning_patterns(learning_history)
    
    # Identify knowledge gaps
    knowledge_gaps = await self._identify_knowledge_gaps(ai_type, subjects, content_analysis)
    
    # Analyze learning depth
    learning_depth = await self._analyze_learning_depth(content_analysis)
    
    return {
        "learned_topics": subjects,
        "knowledge_gaps": knowledge_gaps,
        "learning_patterns": learning_patterns,
        "learning_depth": learning_depth,
        "learning_strengths": learning_patterns.get('strengths', []),
        "learning_weaknesses": learning_patterns.get('weaknesses', [])
    }
```

### 2. **Proposal Pattern Analysis (`_analyze_ai_proposal_patterns`)**

```python
async def _analyze_ai_proposal_patterns(self, ai_type: str, recent_proposals: List[Dict]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Analyze AI's proposal patterns to understand strengths and weaknesses"""
    
    # Analyze success rates
    success_rate = len(successful_proposals) / total_proposals
    
    # Classify improvement types
    for proposal in recent_proposals:
        improvement_type = await self._classify_improvement_type(code_before, code_after)
        code_patterns.append(improvement_type)
    
    # Analyze code quality trends
    quality_trends = await self._analyze_code_quality_trends(recent_proposals)
    
    return {
        "proposal_count": total_proposals,
        "success_rate": success_rate,
        "improvement_areas": list(set(improvement_areas)),
        "code_quality_trends": quality_trends
    }
```

### 3. **Learning Pattern Analysis (`_analyze_learning_patterns`)**

```python
async def _analyze_learning_patterns(self, learning_history: List[Dict]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Analyze patterns in AI's learning behavior"""
    
    # Analyze learning frequency
    learning_frequency = len(learning_dates) / max(1, days_since_first_learning)
    
    # Analyze subject diversity
    subject_diversity = unique_subjects / total_subjects
    
    # Analyze content depth
    avg_content_length = sum(content_lengths) / len(content_lengths)
    
    # Identify strengths and weaknesses
    if learning_frequency > 0.5:
        strengths.append("Consistent learning frequency")
    if subject_diversity > 0.7:
        strengths.append("Diverse learning subjects")
    if avg_content_length > 500:
        strengths.append("Deep learning content")
```

## 🎯 **Adaptive Test Generation**

### 1. **Knowledge Gap Targeting**

The system identifies what each AI should know but doesn't:

```python
# Define expected knowledge for each AI type
expected_knowledge = {
    "imperium": ["system architecture", "cross-ai collaboration", "strategic planning"],
    "guardian": ["security principles", "code quality", "testing methodologies"],
    "sandbox": ["experimental design", "innovation techniques", "prototyping"],
    "conquest": ["app development", "user experience", "market analysis"]
}

# Find gaps in current knowledge
for expected in ai_expected:
    if not any(expected in knowledge for knowledge in current_knowledge):
        knowledge_gaps.append(expected)
```

### 2. **Learning Depth Assessment**

The system measures how deeply each AI has learned:

```python
async def _analyze_learning_depth(self, content_analysis: List[str]) -> str:
    """Analyze the depth of AI's learning based on content"""
    
    # Analyze content complexity
    total_length = sum(len(content) for content in content_analysis)
    avg_length = total_length / len(content_analysis)
    
    # Count technical terms
    technical_terms = sum(content.lower().count(term) for content in content_analysis)
    
    # Determine depth level
    if avg_length > 1000 and technical_terms > 10:
        return "expert"
    elif avg_length > 500 and technical_terms > 5:
        return "advanced"
    elif avg_length > 200 and technical_terms > 2:
        return "intermediate"
    else:
        return "basic"
```

### 3. **Proposal Success Pattern Analysis**

The system learns from proposal outcomes:

```python
async def _classify_improvement_type(self, code_before: str, code_after: str) -> str:
    """Classify the type of improvement made in a proposal"""
    
    if len(code_after) > len(code_before) * 1.5:
        return "feature_addition"
    elif len(code_after) < len(code_before) * 0.8:
        return "code_optimization"
    elif "def " in code_after and "def " not in code_before:
        return "function_addition"
    elif "class " in code_after and "class " not in code_before:
        return "class_addition"
    elif "try:" in code_after and "try:" not in code_before:
        return "error_handling"
    else:
        return "code_refactoring"
```

## 📊 **Test Intelligence Features**

### 1. **Adaptive Question Generation**

Questions are generated based on actual learning:

```python
# Basic questions target recent learning
if learned_topics:
    questions.append(f"What did you learn about {recent_topic}?")

# Intermediate questions test application
if learned_topics:
    questions.append(f"How would you apply {recent_topic} to improve performance?")

# Advanced questions test synthesis
if len(learned_topics) >= 3:
    questions.append(f"Design a system that integrates {', '.join(learned_topics[-3:])}")

# Expert questions test innovation
questions.append(f"Design a revolutionary {ai_type} AI system")
```

### 2. **Success Rate-Based Testing**

Tests adapt based on proposal success patterns:

```python
# Target improvement areas for low success rates
if success_rate < 0.7:
    questions.append("What patterns do you notice in your failed proposals?")

# Challenge high performers
elif success_rate > 0.9:
    questions.append("How would you maintain success while taking on more challenges?")

# Focus on specific improvement areas
if improvement_areas:
    questions.append(f"Analyze issues in your recent {area} proposals")
```

### 3. **Learning Pattern Awareness**

Tests evaluate self-awareness of learning patterns:

```python
# Test awareness of weaknesses
if weaknesses:
    questions.append(f"How would you address your weakness in {weakness.lower()}?")

# Test learning strategy optimization
if total_learning > 20:
    questions.append("How would you optimize your learning strategy?")

# Test improvement planning
if success_rate < 0.8:
    questions.append("What systematic improvements would you make?")
```
