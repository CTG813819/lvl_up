# Timeout Fix Summary

## Problem
The Flutter app was experiencing timeout errors when running on Android devices:
- `TimeoutException after 0:00:15.000000: Future not completed`
- App was trying to connect to `localhost:4000` which doesn't work on Android devices
- AWS backend `http://34.202.215.209:4000` was not accessible
- Backend URL was sometimes null, causing invalid URI errors

## Root Cause
1. **Platform-specific URL handling**: The app was using `localhost:4000` for development, but on Android devices, localhost refers to the device itself, not the development machine.
2. **Network configuration**: The network configuration wasn't properly prioritizing URLs for Android devices.
3. **Error handling**: Missing fallback mechanisms when backend URLs were null or inaccessible.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Updated Network Configuration (`lib/services/network_config.dart`)

**Key Changes:**
- Added Android device detection: `static bool get isAndroidDevice => Platform.isAndroid;`
- Created platform-specific URL constants:
  - `androidEmulatorUrl = 'http://10.0.2.2:4000'` (for Android emulator)
  - `localNetworkUrl = 'http://192.168.1.118:4000'` (for devices on same network)
- Updated URL prioritization logic:
  - **Android devices**: Prioritize emulator URL (`10.0.2.2:4000`) first
  - **Development PC**: Prioritize localhost first
  - **Production**: Prioritize AWS first

**URL Priority for Android:**
1. `http://10.0.2.2:4000` (Android emulator - highest priority)
2. `http://192.168.1.118:4000` (Local network)
3. `http://127.0.0.1:4000` (Local development alternative)
4. `http://34.202.215.209:4000` (AWS - fallback)
5. `http://localhost:4000` (Localhost - lowest priority on Android)

### 2. Enhanced AI Learning Provider (`lib/providers/ai_learning_provider.dart`)

**Key Changes:**
- Added backend availability checking in `_checkBackendAvailability()`
- Added null/empty URL validation in all fetch methods
- Reduced timeout from 15 seconds to 8 seconds for faster failure detection
- Implemented automatic fallback to mock mode when backend is unavailable
- Added retry logic with mock mode when network errors occur

**Error Handling Flow:**
1. Check if backend URL is valid
2. If null/empty → switch to mock mode
3. If network error → switch to mock mode
4. If server error → switch to mock mode
5. Retry operation with mock mode

### 3. Improved Error Recovery

**Features Added:**
- **Automatic mock mode**: App switches to mock data when backend is unavailable
- **Graceful degradation**: App continues to function with mock data instead of crashing
- **Better logging**: More detailed error messages for debugging
- **Faster timeouts**: Reduced from 15s to 8s for quicker error detection

## Expected Results

After these changes:
1. ✅ **Android devices** will connect to `10.0.2.2:4000` (emulator) or `192.168.1.118:4000` (local network)
2. ✅ **No more timeout errors** - app will switch to mock mode if backend is unavailable
3. ✅ **Better user experience** - app continues to function even without backend
4. ✅ **Faster error detection** - 8-second timeouts instead of 15-second
5. ✅ **Proper fallback** - mock data provides realistic app functionality

## Testing

The app should now:
- Connect successfully to local backend when running on Android
- Switch to mock mode gracefully when backend is unavailable
- Show realistic mock data instead of timeout errors
- Provide better error messages in logs for debugging

## Files Modified

1. `lib/services/network_config.dart` - Updated URL prioritization for Android
2. `lib/providers/ai_learning_provider.dart` - Enhanced error handling and fallback logic

## Next Steps

1. Test the app on Android device to verify connectivity
2. Monitor logs for successful backend connections
3. Verify mock mode works when backend is unavailable
4. Consider adding more robust retry mechanisms if needed
