# Dynamic Difficulty Scaling and Learning System

## Overview
The enhanced adversarial testing service now includes a comprehensive dynamic difficulty scaling and learning system that evaluates AI responses, determines winners/losers, applies difficulty adjustments, and triggers learning from competition results.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Dynamic Difficulty Scaling System**
- **Winner Bonus**: +0.5 difficulty multiplier (e.g., 1.0 ‚Üí 1.5)
- **Loser Penalty**: -0.25 difficulty multiplier (e.g., 1.5 ‚Üí 1.25)
- **Scenario Difficulty**: Calculated as average of participating AI difficulty multipliers
- **Bounds**: Minimum 0.5, Maximum 3.0 difficulty multiplier

### 2. **AI Learning System**
- **Victory Learning**: Winners learn from successful strategies
- **Defeat Learning**: Losers analyze what went wrong and study winner strategies
- **Learning History**: Comprehensive tracking of all learning events
- **Integration**: Connects with existing AI learning and metrics services

### 3. **Competition Evaluation System**
- **Response Evaluation**: Each AI response is evaluated on multiple criteria
- **Winner Determination**: Clear winner/loser identification based on scores
- **Rankings**: Complete ranking system for all participants
- **Competition Types**: Clear winner, tie, or no winners

### 4. **Win/Loss Tracking**
- **Record Keeping**: Tracks wins, losses, and total games for each AI
- **Performance Metrics**: Comprehensive performance analytics
- **Historical Data**: Maintains complete competition history

## How It Works

### **Scenario Generation with Dynamic Difficulty**
```python
# Calculate scenario difficulty based on AI difficulty multipliers
scenario_difficulty = self._calculate_scenario_difficulty(ai_types)

# Adjust complexity based on dynamic difficulty
complexity = self._adjust_complexity_for_difficulty(complexity, scenario_difficulty)

# Add dynamic difficulty information to scenario
scenario["dynamic_difficulty"] = {
    "scenario_difficulty": scenario_difficulty,
    "ai_difficulty_multipliers": {...},
    "win_loss_records": {...}
}
```

### **Winner Determination and Difficulty Scaling**
```python
# Determine winners and losers
winner_analysis = await self._determine_scenario_winners(results)

# Apply dynamic difficulty scaling
await self._apply_dynamic_difficulty_scaling(winners, losers)

# Trigger learning from competition results
await self._trigger_ai_learning(winners, losers, results)
```

### **Learning from Competition**
```python
# Winners learn from victory
await self._learn_from_victory(winner, result)

# Losers learn from defeat and winner strategies
await self._learn_from_defeat(loser, loser_result, winner_result)
```

## Dynamic Difficulty Scaling Rules

### **Difficulty Multiplier Changes**
- **Winner**: +0.5 multiplier (e.g., 1.0 ‚Üí 1.5)
- **Loser**: -0.25 multiplier (e.g., 1.5 ‚Üí 1.25)
- **Bounds**: 0.5 (minimum) to 3.0 (maximum)

### **Scenario Difficulty Calculation**
- **Formula**: Average of all participating AI difficulty multipliers
- **Example**: 
  - Imperium: 1.5, Guardian: 0.75
  - Scenario Difficulty: (1.5 + 0.75) / 2 = 1.125

### **Complexity Adjustment**
- **High Difficulty (‚â•2.0)**: Increase complexity by 2 levels
- **Medium-High (‚â•1.5)**: Increase complexity by 1 level
- **Low Difficulty (‚â§0.75)**: Decrease complexity by 1 level
- **Normal (0.75-1.5)**: Keep current complexity

## Learning System Details

### **Victory Learning**
- **Type**: `victory_learning`
- **Lessons**: Reinforce successful strategies, maintain high standards
- **Integration**: Updates AI learning service and metrics

### **Defeat Learning**
- **Type**: `defeat_learning`
- **Lessons**: Analyze failures, study winner strategies, improve weak areas
- **Integration**: Records winner strategies for analysis

### **Learning Events Structure**
```python
learning_event = {
    "type": "victory_learning" | "defeat_learning",
    "ai_type": "imperium" | "guardian" | "sandbox" | "conquest",
    "timestamp": "2025-07-27T19:30:00Z",
    "score": 85,
    "feedback": "Detailed feedback on performance",
    "lessons_learned": ["Lesson 1", "Lesson 2", "Lesson 3"],
    "difficulty_multiplier": 1.5
}
```

- **Scenario Adaptation**: Scenarios adapt to AI difficulty levels

## Example Competition Flow

### **Initial State**
```
Imperium: Difficulty=1.0, Wins=0, Losses=0
Guardian: Difficulty=1.0, Wins=0, Losses=0
Sandbox: Difficulty=1.0, Wins=0, Losses=0
Conquest: Difficulty=1.0, Wins=0, Losses=0
```

### **After Competition (Imperium wins)**
```
üèÜ Imperium WON! Difficulty increased: 1.00 ‚Üí 1.50
üíî Guardian LOST! Difficulty decreased: 1.00 ‚Üí 0.75
üíî Sandbox LOST! Difficulty decreased: 1.00 ‚Üí 0.75
üíî Conquest LOST! Difficulty decreased: 1.00 ‚Üí 0.75

Updated State:
Imperium: Difficulty=1.5, Wins=1, Losses=0
Guardian: Difficulty=0.75, Wins=0, Losses=1
Sandbox: Difficulty=0.75, Wins=0, Losses=1
Conquest: Difficulty=0.75, Wins=0, Losses=1
```

### **Next Scenario Difficulty**
```
Scenario Difficulty: (1.5 + 0.75 + 0.75 + 0.75) / 4 = 0.94
Complexity: Adjusted based on 0.94 difficulty multiplier
```
