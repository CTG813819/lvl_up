elif avg_recent_score >= 80 and consecutive_successes >= 3:
    level = "advanced"
elif avg_recent_score >= 70:
    level = "intermediate"
elif avg_recent_score >= 50:
    level = "basic"
else:
    level = "beginner"
```

### 4. Dynamic Complexity Calculation
```python
# Base complexity from difficulty
base_complexity = {
    TestDifficulty.BASIC: 1,
    TestDifficulty.INTERMEDIATE: 2,
    TestDifficulty.ADVANCED: 3,
    TestDifficulty.EXPERT: 4,
    TestDifficulty.MASTER: 5,
    TestDifficulty.LEGENDARY: 6
}

# Learning-based multiplier
learning_multiplier = {
    'beginner': 0.8,    # Reduce complexity for beginners
    'basic': 1.0,       # Standard complexity
    'intermediate': 1.2, # Slight increase
    'advanced': 1.5,    # Moderate increase
    'expert': 2.0       # Significant increase
}

# Apply strength bonuses and weakness reductions
if 'high_performance' in strengths:
    learning_multiplier += 0.3
if 'struggling_with_complexity' in weaknesses:
    learning_multiplier *= 0.7
```

### 4. Dynamic Enhancement
```python
# Add complexity layers based on learning level
if learning_level in ['advanced', 'expert']:
    enhanced_scenario += "\n\n**Advanced Challenge**: Incorporate advanced patterns and optimization techniques."

# Add performance-focused challenges
if 'high_performance' in strengths:
    enhanced_scenario += "\n\n**Performance Focus**: Optimize for maximum performance and scalability."

# Add guidance for struggling AIs
if 'struggling_with_complexity' in weaknesses:
