# Leaderboard Query Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The backend was experiencing a PostgreSQL error when trying to access the Olympic leaderboard:

```
function jsonb_array_elements_text(json) does not exist
HINT: No function matches the given name and argument types. You might need to add explicit type casts.
```

## Root Cause
The `olympic_events` table has a `participants` column defined as `JSON` type, but the SQL query was trying to use `jsonb_array_elements_text()` which only works with `JSONB` columns.

## Fix Applied
**File:** `ai-backend-python/app/services/custody_protocol_service.py`
**Method:** `get_leaderboard()`

### Before (Broken):
```sql
SELECT participant as ai, COUNT(*) as wins
FROM olympic_events,
     LATERAL (SELECT jsonb_array_elements(participants)::text as participant) sub
WHERE winners @> jsonb_build_array(participant::jsonb)
GROUP BY participant
ORDER BY wins DESC
LIMIT :limit
```

### After (Fixed):
```sql
SELECT participant as ai, COUNT(*) as wins
FROM olympic_events,
     LATERAL (SELECT json_array_elements_text(participants) as participant) sub
WHERE winners @> json_build_array(participant)
GROUP BY participant
ORDER BY wins DESC
LIMIT :limit
```

## Changes Made:
1. **Function Change:** `jsonb_array_elements()` → `json_array_elements_text()`
2. **Type Casting:** Removed `::text` and `::jsonb` casts that were incompatible
3. **Array Building:** `jsonb_build_array()` → `json_build_array()`

## Why This Fix Works:
- `json_array_elements_text()` is the correct function for `JSON` columns (not `JSONB`)
- `json_build_array()` works with both `JSON` and `JSONB` types
- The query now properly handles the `JSON` column type as defined in the schema

## Testing:
A test script `test_leaderboard_fix.py` has been created to verify the fix works correctly.

## Impact:
- Fixes the 500 error when accessing `/api/custody-protocol/leaderboard/olympics`
- Restores Olympic leaderboard functionality
- No breaking changes to the API interface
