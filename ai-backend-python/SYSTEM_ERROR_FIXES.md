# System Error Fixes - July 19, 2025

## Overview
This document summarizes the critical fixes applied to resolve system errors that were preventing proper operation of the AI backend services, and the implementation of the strict leveling system that matches the Dart AI growth analytics.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Proposal Creation Blocking Issue - RESOLVED WITH STRICT LEVELING**
**Problem**: Guardian AI (and potentially other AIs) were being blocked from creating proposals due to custody requirements.

**Root Cause**: The system needed to implement the same strict leveling system used in the Dart AI growth analytics.

**Solution**: Implemented strict leveling system matching Dart implementation:
- **Level Thresholds**: [100, 300, 600, 1000, 1500, 2200, 3000, 4000, 5000, 10000] learning score
- **Basic Requirements**: Must have passed at least one test, ≤3 consecutive failures, test passed in last 24 hours
- **Level-Based Requirements**:
  - Level 1-2: At least 1 learning cycle
  - Level 3-4: At least 3 learning cycles  
  - Level 5+: At least 5 learning cycles + 80% success rate
- **Level Descriptions**: Novice → Apprentice → Journeyman → Expert → Master → Grandmaster → Legend → Mythic → Divine → Transcendent

**Files Modified**: `ai-backend-python/app/services/custody_protocol_service.py`

### 2. **OathPaper Database Query Error**
**Problem**: `'CustodyProtocolService' object has no attribute '_generate_recommendation_based_test'`

**Root Cause**: The code was trying to query `OathPaper.ai_type` but the model doesn't have this attribute.

**Solution**: 
- Changed query from `OathPaper.ai_type` to `OathPaper.category`
- Added missing `_generate_recommendation_based_test` method
- Added missing `_train_sckipit_models` method

**Files Modified**: `ai-backend-python/app/services/custody_protocol_service.py`

### 3. **Question Generation Errors**
**Problem**: `'str' object has no attribute 'get'` errors in question generation

**Root Cause**: The `_generate_internet_based_tests` method was trying to call `.get()` on a string response from `anthropic_rate_limited_call`.

**Solution**: 
- Added proper type checking for response handling
- Added JSON parsing with fallback error handling
- Added fallback question generation when parsing fails
- Improved error logging with response content

**Files Modified**: `ai-backend-python/app/services/custody_protocol_service.py`

### 4. **Missing Method Implementations**
**Problem**: Several methods were referenced but not implemented:
- `_generate_recommendation_based_test`
- `_train_sckipit_models`

**Solution**: Added complete implementations for all missing methods with proper error handling and logging.

## Technical Details

### Strict Leveling System (Matching Dart Implementation)
```python
# Level calculation using same thresholds as Dart
thresholds = [100, 300, 600, 1000, 1500, 2200, 3000, 4000, 5000, 10000]

# Proposal eligibility requirements
if metrics["total_tests_passed"] == 0:
    return False  # Must have passed at least one test

if metrics["consecutive_failures"] > 3:
    return False  # Must not have too many consecutive failures

if time_since_last > timedelta(hours=24):
    return False  # Must have passed a test in the last 24 hours

# Level-based learning cycle requirements
if level <= 2 and total_learning_cycles < 1:
    return False  # Level 1-2: At least 1 learning cycle

if 3 <= level <= 4 and total_learning_cycles < 3:
    return False  # Level 3-4: At least 3 learning cycles

if level >= 5 and total_learning_cycles < 5:
    return False  # Level 5+: At least 5 learning cycles

# Success rate requirement for high levels
if level >= 5 and success_rate < 0.8:
    return False  # Level 5+: 80% success rate required
```

### Question Generation Error Handling
```python
# Fix: response is a string, not a dict, so we need to parse it
if isinstance(response, str):
    questions_data = json.loads(response)
else:
    # If response is already a dict, use it directly
    questions_data = response
```

### Database Query Fix
```python
# Fix: OathPaper doesn't have ai_type, use category instead
result = await s.execute(
    select(OathPaper)
    .where(OathPaper.category == ai_type)
    .order_by(OathPaper.created_at.desc())
    .limit(20)
)
```

## Impact Assessment

### Positive Impacts
1. **Consistent Leveling System**: Backend now matches Dart frontend leveling exactly
2. **Strict Quality Control**: Ensures only qualified AIs can create proposals
3. **Improved Error Handling**: Better resilience against API failures and parsing errors
4. **Enhanced Logging**: More detailed error messages for debugging
5. **System Stability**: Reduced crashes and error cascades

### Risk Mitigation
1. **Maintained Security**: Strict requirements ensure quality proposals
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback mechanisms prevent complete system failure
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing functionality preserved
4. **Consistent Experience**: Frontend and backend now use identical leveling logic
