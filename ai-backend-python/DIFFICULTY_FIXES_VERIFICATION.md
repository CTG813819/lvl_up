# Difficulty Fixes Verification

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Difficulty showing as "unknown" in test_history
**Problem**: The difficulty was not being properly extracted from the test_result dictionary and was showing as "unknown" in test_history entries.

**Fix**: Enhanced the difficulty extraction logic in `_update_custody_metrics` method:
- Added detailed logging to track difficulty extraction
- Added fallback logging to show full test_result when difficulty is missing
- Improved error handling for difficulty extraction

**Code Changes**:
```python
# Ensure difficulty is properly set from test result
if test_result.get("difficulty"):
    test_history_entry["difficulty"] = test_result["difficulty"]
    logger.info(f"[CUSTODY METRICS] Set difficulty from test_result['difficulty']: {test_result['difficulty']}")
elif test_result.get("test_difficulty"):
    test_history_entry["difficulty"] = test_result["test_difficulty"]
    logger.info(f"[CUSTODY METRICS] Set difficulty from test_result['test_difficulty']: {test_result['test_difficulty']}")
else:
    # Log the test result to debug what's available
    logger.warning(f"[CUSTODY METRICS] No difficulty found in test_result for {ai_type}. Available keys: {list(test_result.keys())}")
    logger.warning(f"[CUSTODY METRICS] Full test_result for {ai_type}: {json.dumps(test_result, default=str, ensure_ascii=False)}")
    test_history_entry["difficulty"] = "unknown"
```

### 2. XP not being persisted
**Problem**: XP values were not being properly saved to the database.

**Fix**: Enhanced XP persistence logging and ensured proper field mapping:
- Added detailed logging for XP values
- Ensured both `xp` and `custody_xp` fields are properly set
- Added verification logging

**Code Changes**:
```python
# Ensure XP is properly saved
metrics["xp"] = metrics.get("custody_xp", 0)  # Ensure XP field is set
logger.info(f"[CUSTODY METRICS] Final XP for {ai_type}: {metrics['xp']} (custody_xp: {metrics.get('custody_xp', 0)})")
```

### 3. Current difficulty remains "intermediate" despite 104 consecutive failures
**Problem**: The difficulty adjustment logic was not aggressive enough for high consecutive failure counts.

**Fix**: Made difficulty adjustment more aggressive for consecutive failures:
- Increased difficulty decrease for 3+ consecutive failures (from 1 to 2 levels)
- Increased difficulty decrease for 5+ consecutive failures (from 2 to 3 levels)
- Increased difficulty decrease for 10+ consecutive failures (from 3 to 4 levels)
- Added new threshold for 20+ consecutive failures (5 levels decrease)

**Code Changes**:
```python
# More aggressive difficulty adjustment for consecutive failures
if consecutive_failures >= 20:
    # AI is failing consistently for a very long time - decrease difficulty dramatically
    return self._decrease_difficulty(base_difficulty, 5)
elif consecutive_failures >= 10:
    # AI is failing consistently for a long time - decrease difficulty significantly
    return self._decrease_difficulty(base_difficulty, 4)
elif consecutive_failures >= 5:
    # AI is failing consistently - decrease difficulty moderately
    return self._decrease_difficulty(base_difficulty, 3)
elif consecutive_failures >= 3:
    # AI is struggling - decrease difficulty
    return self._decrease_difficulty(base_difficulty, 2)
```

### 4. Generic AI responses instead of practical scenarios
**Problem**: AI responses were too generic and not addressing specific test scenarios.

**Fix**: Enhanced test prompts to be more specific and practical:
- Added explicit instructions to avoid generic responses
- Required specific, actionable solutions
- Added focus on real-world practical solutions
- Required specific code examples and steps

**Code Changes**:
```python
# Enhanced test prompt instructions
scenario_instructions = f"""
IMPORTANT: You are {ai_type.upper()} AI. You must address the specific test scenario provided.
Do NOT give generic responses. You must:
1. Read and understand the specific scenario/question
2. Provide a detailed, relevant answer that directly addresses the scenario
3. Show your reasoning and approach
4. Include practical examples or code if applicable
5. Demonstrate your unique {ai_type} perspective and capabilities
6. Focus on real-world practical solutions
7. Provide specific, actionable steps or code examples
8. Address the exact requirements of the scenario

Test Scenario: {test_content.get('scenario', test_content.get('question', 'No specific scenario provided'))}
Test Category: {category.value}
Difficulty Level: {difficulty.value}

CRITICAL: Your response must be specific to this scenario. Do not give generic advice.
Please respond to the above scenario with your {ai_type} expertise:

## Test Script

Created `test_difficulty_fixes_verification.py` to verify all fixes work correctly:

```bash
python test_difficulty_fixes_verification.py
```

This script tests:
1. Proper difficulty logging in test_history
2. XP persistence
3. More aggressive difficulty adjustment for consecutive failures
4. Specific, non-generic AI responses

## Expected Results

After these fixes:
1. ✅ Difficulty should be properly logged in test_history (not "unknown")
2. ✅ XP should be properly persisted and incremented
3. ✅ Difficulty should decrease more aggressively for consecutive failures
4. ✅ AI responses should be more specific and practical
5. ✅ Current difficulty should adjust from "intermediate" to "basic" after 104 consecutive failures

## Verification Steps

1. Run the test script to verify fixes
2. Check logs for proper difficulty extraction
3. Verify XP persistence in database
4. Confirm difficulty adjustment for high failure counts
5. Review AI responses for specificity and practicality
