# Critical Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. DateTime Import Error
**Problem**: `UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'datetime' where it is not associated with a value`

**Root Cause**: The `datetime` import was inside a try block, but `datetime.utcnow()` was being called outside the try block.

**Fix**: 
- Added `from datetime import datetime` import at the beginning of the `_update_custody_metrics` method
- Added `from datetime import datetime` import in the exception handler

**Code Changes**:
```python
async def _update_custody_metrics(self, ai_type: str, test_result: Dict):
    try:
        from datetime import datetime
        import json
        # ... rest of method
    except Exception as e:
        from datetime import datetime
        test_history_entry["timestamp"] = datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
```

### 2. Difficulty Adjustment Not Working
**Problem**: Current difficulty remained "intermediate" despite 122 consecutive failures

**Root Cause**: The difficulty adjustment was using `_decrease_difficulty` method which couldn't go below the minimum difficulty level.

**Fix**: 
- Changed difficulty adjustment to force difficulty to `TestDifficulty.BASIC` for 3+ consecutive failures
- Added detailed logging to track difficulty adjustment process

**Code Changes**:
```python
# More aggressive difficulty adjustment for consecutive failures
if consecutive_failures >= 20:
    logger.info(f"[DIFFICULTY ADJUSTMENT] Forcing difficulty to BASIC due to {consecutive_failures} consecutive failures")
    return TestDifficulty.BASIC
elif consecutive_failures >= 10:
    logger.info(f"[DIFFICULTY ADJUSTMENT] Forcing difficulty to BASIC due to {consecutive_failures} consecutive failures")
    return TestDifficulty.BASIC
elif consecutive_failures >= 5:
    logger.info(f"[DIFFICULTY ADJUSTMENT] Forcing difficulty to BASIC due to {consecutive_failures} consecutive failures")
    return TestDifficulty.BASIC
elif consecutive_failures >= 3:
    logger.info(f"[DIFFICULTY ADJUSTMENT] Forcing difficulty to BASIC due to {consecutive_failures} consecutive failures")
    return TestDifficulty.BASIC
```

### 3. Difficulty Logging in Test History
**Problem**: Difficulty showing as "unknown" in test_history entries

**Root Cause**: The difficulty was not being properly extracted from the test_result dictionary.

**Fix**: Enhanced the difficulty extraction logic with better logging and fallback handling.

**Code Changes**:
```python
# Ensure difficulty is properly set from test result
if test_result.get("difficulty"):
    test_history_entry["difficulty"] = test_result["difficulty"]
    logger.info(f"[CUSTODY METRICS] Set difficulty from test_result['difficulty']: {test_result['difficulty']}")
elif test_result.get("test_difficulty"):
    test_history_entry["difficulty"] = test_result["test_difficulty"]
    logger.info(f"[CUSTODY METRICS] Set difficulty from test_result['test_difficulty']: {test_result['test_difficulty']}")
else:
    logger.warning(f"[CUSTODY METRICS] No difficulty found in test_result for {ai_type}. Available keys: {list(test_result.keys())}")
    test_history_entry["difficulty"] = "unknown"
```

## Test Script

Created `test_critical_fixes.py` to verify all fixes work correctly:

```bash
python test_critical_fixes.py
```

This script tests:
1. DateTime import error fix
2. Difficulty adjustment for consecutive failures
3. Difficulty logging in test_history

## Expected Results

After these fixes:
1. ✅ No more `UnboundLocalError` for datetime
2. ✅ Difficulty should be forced to "basic" after 3+ consecutive failures
3. ✅ Difficulty should be properly logged in test_history (not "unknown")
4. ✅ XP should be properly persisted

## Verification Steps

1. Run the test script to verify fixes
2. Check logs for proper difficulty adjustment messages
3. Verify difficulty is set to "basic" for AIs with high consecutive failures
4. Confirm difficulty is properly logged in test_history
