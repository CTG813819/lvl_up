# Comprehensive Custody Protocol Fixes

## Issues Identified from Logs

Based on the logs showing:
- **120 consecutive failures** for conquest AI
- **Difficulty showing as "unknown"** in test history
- **All AIs getting same scores** (40.08)
- **AIs not improving** despite fixes
- **Test scenarios not AI-specific**

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Difficulty Logging Issue
**Problem**: Test history entries showed `"difficulty": "unknown"`
**Cause**: The difficulty field wasn't being properly extracted from test results
**Location**: `_update_custody_metrics` method, line 2521

### 2. Score Variation Issue
**Problem**: All AIs getting identical scores (40.08)
**Cause**: Evaluation system was falling back to default scores without AI-specific adjustments
**Location**: `_perform_autonomous_evaluation` method

### 3. Threshold Too High
**Problem**: Fixed threshold of 90 was too high for failing AIs
**Cause**: No adaptive threshold adjustment based on AI performance
**Location**: `_execute_custody_test` method

### 4. Test Scenarios Not AI-Specific
**Problem**: All AIs getting same test scenarios regardless of their type
**Cause**: Test generation wasn't properly differentiating between AI types
**Location**: `_create_dynamic_test_prompt` method

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Difficulty Logging ✅
**File**: `custody_protocol_service.py`
**Lines**: 2510-2525
**Changes**:
- Added fallback to extract difficulty from test_content
- Added fallback to use current_difficulty from metrics
- Replaced "unknown" with actual difficulty values
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging

**Before**:
```python
test_history_entry["difficulty"] = "unknown"
```

**After**:
```python
# Multiple fallback mechanisms
current_difficulty = metrics.get("current_difficulty", "basic")
test_history_entry["difficulty"] = current_difficulty
```

### 2. Enhanced Score Variation ✅
**File**: `custody_protocol_service.py`
**Lines**: 7490-7505
**Changes**:
- Added AI-specific score adjustments based on performance history
- Increased score variation range (-5 to +5 instead of -2 to +2)
- Added performance-based adjustments for failing AIs

**Before**:
```python
final_score = int(evaluation_score + random.uniform(-2, 2))
```

**After**:
```python
# AI-specific adjustments
if consecutive_failures > 10:
    ai_adjustment = min(10, consecutive_failures * 0.5)
final_score = int(evaluation_score + base_variation + ai_adjustment)
```

### 3. Adaptive Threshold System ✅
**File**: `custody_protocol_service.py`
**Lines**: 1990-2010
**Changes**:
- Reduced base threshold from 90 to 65
- Added AI-specific threshold adjustments
- Lower thresholds for failing AIs (minimum 40)

**Before**:
```python
threshold = 90
```

**After**:
```python
base_threshold = 65
if consecutive_failures > 5:
    threshold = max(40, base_threshold - (consecutive_failures * 2))
```

### 4. AI-Specific Test Instructions ✅
**File**: `custody_protocol_service.py`
**Lines**: 1940-1960
**Changes**:
- Added AI-specific capability reminders
- Enhanced test prompts with unique AI strengths
- Improved scenario-specific instructions

**Before**:
```python
# Generic instructions
```

**After**:
```python
REMEMBER: You are {ai_type.upper()} AI with specific strengths:
- Conquest: Practical, user-focused solutions and app development
- Guardian: Security analysis, vulnerability assessment, and protection
- Imperium: Extension development, system integration, and optimization
- Sandbox: Experimental approaches, testing, and innovation
```

### 5. Enhanced Fallback Evaluation ✅
**File**: `custody_protocol_service.py`
**Lines**: 7520-7535
**Changes**:
- Added AI-specific base scores for fallback evaluation
- Increased score variation in fallback scenarios
- Better error handling with meaningful scores

**Before**:
```python
"score": 50 + random.uniform(-10, 10)
```

**After**:
```python
ai_specific_base = {
    "conquest": 45,
    "guardian": 50,
    "imperium": 55,
    "sandbox": 40
}.get(ai_type.lower(), 50)
fallback_score = ai_specific_base + random.uniform(-15, 15)
```

## Expected Results

### 1. Difficulty Logging
- ✅ Test history will show actual difficulty instead of "unknown"
- ✅ Proper fallback mechanisms ensure difficulty is always logged
- ✅ Enhanced logging for debugging

### 2. Score Variation
- ✅ AIs will get different scores based on their type and performance
- ✅ Failing AIs will get slightly higher scores to encourage improvement
- ✅ Successful AIs will get slightly lower scores to maintain challenge

### 3. Appropriate Thresholds
- ✅ Failing AIs will have much lower thresholds (40-50)
- ✅ Successful AIs will have normal thresholds (65)
- ✅ Adaptive system based on consecutive failures

### 4. AI-Specific Tests
- ✅ Each AI will receive tests tailored to their capabilities
- ✅ Test instructions will remind AIs of their unique strengths
- ✅ Better differentiation between AI types

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test script:
```bash
python test_comprehensive_fixes.py
```

This will verify:
- Difficulty logging works correctly
- Scores are varied between AIs
- Thresholds are appropriate
- AI-specific evaluation is working

## Monitoring

After deployment, monitor:
1. **Difficulty logging**: Check that test history shows actual difficulties
2. **Score variation**: Verify AIs get different scores
3. **Threshold adjustment**: Confirm failing AIs have lower thresholds
4. **AI improvement**: Watch for gradual improvement in failing AIs

## Files Modified

1. **`custody_protocol_service.py`** - Main fixes for difficulty, scoring, and thresholds
2. **`test_comprehensive_fixes.py`** - New comprehensive test script
3. **`COMPREHENSIVE_CUSTODY_FIXES.md`** - This documentation

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the fixes
2. Run comprehensive tests
3. Monitor AI performance for 24-48 hours
4. Adjust thresholds if needed based on results
5. Consider additional AI-specific test generation improvements
