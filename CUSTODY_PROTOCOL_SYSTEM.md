# üõ°Ô∏è Custody Protocol System

## Overview

The **Custody Protocol System** is a comprehensive AI testing and monitoring framework that ensures all AIs must pass rigorous tests before they can create proposals, level up, or perform critical operations. This system implements the concept of "self-testing and vigilance" where AIs continuously validate their knowledge and capabilities.
