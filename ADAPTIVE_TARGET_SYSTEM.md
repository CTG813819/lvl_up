# 🎯 Adaptive Target Generation System

## Overview

The Adaptive Target Generation System creates **dynamically evolving targets** based on AI learning history and performance. Targets become more complex and challenging as the AI improves, ensuring continuous learning and skill development.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. **AI Learning Analysis**
- Analyzes AI performance across different vulnerability types
- Identifies strengths and weaknesses based on success rates
- Calculates learning levels (novice → beginner → intermediate → advanced → expert → master)
- Tracks recent performance trends for adaptive complexity

### 2. **Dynamic Complexity Scaling**
- **Complexity Multiplier**: Adjusts target difficulty based on AI learning level
- **Learning Acceleration**: Increases complexity for rapidly improving AIs
- **Performance Adaptation**: Reduces complexity for struggling AIs
- **Real-time Evolution**: Targets can evolve during active sessions

### 3. **Multi-Target Type Support**
- **Web Applications**: SQL injection, XSS, authentication bypass
- **Desktop Applications**: Buffer overflow, privilege escalation, file inclusion
- **API Services**: JWT weakness, rate limiting bypass, injection attacks
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, cloud service vulnerabilities
- **Expandable**: Easy to add new target types

### 4. **Advanced Vulnerability Mutations**
- **Code Obfuscation**: Variable renaming, string encoding, control flow obfuscation
- **Protection Layers**: WAF bypass, encoding bypass, anti-debugging
- **AI-Specific Challenges**: Harder targets for strong areas, focused learning for weak areas
- **Polymorphic Code**: Dynamic code changes to prevent pattern recognition

## 🎮 How It Works

### 1. **AI Performance Analysis**
```python
# Analyze AI learning history
analysis = await adaptive_service.analyze_ai_performance(ai_id, test_history)

# Results include:
# - learning_level: 'novice' to 'master'
# - strengths: ['sql_injection', 'xss']
# - weaknesses: ['buffer_overflow', 'cryptography']
# - complexity_multiplier: 1.0 to 6.0
```

### 2. **Adaptive Template Generation**
```python
# Generate personalized template
template = await adaptive_service.generate_adaptive_template(base_template, ai_analysis)

# Features added based on AI level:
# - Advanced vulnerabilities for strong areas
# - Focused challenges for weak areas
# - Code obfuscation for expert levels
# - Time limits and stealth requirements
```

### 3. **Real Target Provisioning**
```python
# Create live Docker container
scenario = await adaptive_service.create_learning_based_scenario(
    ai_id='sandbox',
    test_history=learning_history,
    difficulty='medium'
)

# Returns:
# - Real target URL (http://localhost:8080)
# - Live vulnerable application
# - Dynamic credentials and hints
# - Learning objectives and focus areas
```

### 4. **Dynamic Evolution**
```python
# Targets can evolve during sessions
if ai_performance.get('attack_progress', 0) > 0.7:
    target_info = await adaptive_service.evolve_target_complexity(
        target_info, ai_performance
    )
    # Adds: anti-debugging, additional security layers, time pressure
```
