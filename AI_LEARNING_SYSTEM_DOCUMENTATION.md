# AI Learning System Documentation

## Overview

The AI Learning System is a comprehensive framework that enables AIs to learn from each other, improve their source code, and continuously evolve through Git-based version control. This system allows Conquest AI to learn from Imperium, Sandbox, and Guardian AIs, while also enabling each AI to self-improve based on their learning patterns.

## üß† Core Features

### 1. Cross-AI Learning
- **Purpose**: Enable AIs to learn from each other's successful patterns and avoid common mistakes
- **Implementation**: Conquest AI can learn from Imperium, Sandbox, and Guardian AIs
- **Data Sources**: Successful proposals, user feedback, learning patterns, and insights

### 2. Source Code Self-Improvement
- **Purpose**: Allow AIs to improve their own source code based on learned patterns
- **Implementation**: Automatic code improvements with Git integration
- **Features**: Pattern-based improvements, code quality enhancements, performance optimizations

### 3. Git Integration
- **Purpose**: Track and version control AI improvements
- **Implementation**: Automatic commits and pushes to dedicated branches
- **Features**: Learning-based commit messages, branch management, improvement history
